# Introduction

This project is a JavaScript-based faulty calculator designed for educational or entertainment purposes. It demonstrates randomness and basic arithmetic operations while introducing the possibility of incorrect results for some calculations.

# Features

Performs basic mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

Randomly swaps results with a 10% probability to introduce errors.

Easy-to-use interface via prompts and console logs.

Lightweight and browser-based.

# How It Works

The calculator prompts the user for two numbers.

It calculates the results of five operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.

With a 10% chance, it swaps the outputs for operations to simulate faults.

Results are displayed in the browser console.

# Usage

Open the project in a web browser.

Enter two numbers in the prompts that appear.

View the results in the browser console.
